### Synthetic Data Generation
<br>
Upon research of creating a Bi-LSTM model for predicting cyber attacks (in the form of TTP sequences),<br>
it has come to my attention that such models become overfitted, or under-trained for various reasons.<br>
<br>
Some of those reasons include the insufficiency or imbalance of training data.<br>
Many papers in the field use public datasets, or use Natural Language Processing on public CTI reports to extract such TTP sequences.<br>
But this always lead to an imbalanced, insufficient dataset, negatively affecting the accuracy and overall performance of the predictive model.<br>
<br>
This phenomenon has lead my attention to 'Synthetic Data Generation', specifically using a Threat Knowledge Graph that I've constructed before.<br>
So, I took it upon myself to create a data generating method called the "Biased Random Walk on the Threat Knowledge Graph".<br>

This method allows to create a *plausible* yet **diverse** set of TTP sequences, all based on the Threat Knowledge Graph (which is also based on CVE, CWE, TTP relationships and betweenness centralities for bridging nodes.)<br>
<br>
<br>

This is my record on constructing this method into a legitimate method for data generation in the field of predictive model training.<br>
