### Synthetic Data Generation (2)
<br>

I've found many research papers on develping new kinds of IDS systems using various AI model architecture, <br>
and using open datasets like CICIDS-2017, without 'looking into' the data itself.<br><br>

Which is actually pretty odd, considering that the data is almost 10 years old.<br>
It ***must not*** represent the threats of today, that have evolved into so many different paths (APTs, so to speak).<br>
<br>
So, what do others do?<br>
They use data augmentation, on these datasets.<br>
<br>

So essentially, they create synthetic data of the minority data inside those datasets.<br>
<br>

This solves imbalance in the datasets, which are actually crucial to AI training.<br>
The AI model's ability to *catch* the minority data when it actually happens, are poor, since they *'don't know'* what they are.<br>
This is why they artificially create/augment the minority data.<br>
<br>

But they are, in principle, **old data**, aren't they?<br>
<br>
So can't we use other methods to get recent, real, or at least plausible datasets for the AI to train with?
<br>
<br>
<br>
This is my record on constructing this method into a legitimate method for data generation in the field of predictive model training.<br>
